# HTML Projects

This is a collection of my first mini HTML projects while learning web development.

These projects serve as a throwback and a small reminder — for me and for anyone else — that everyone has to start at the beginning. At first, your progress might not seem noticeable, but trust the learning process and keep going!

## Technologies Used

- CSS(background color and font)

These projects serve as a reminder that everyone starts at the beginning. Progress may be slow at first, but with consistent practice, skills grow quickly. Keep experimenting and learning!
